 * The buffer size is the buffer size (in frames) at which OpenSL will operate.
 * Ideally, it should be the native buffer size of OpenSL.  As of Android 4.2,
 * the AudioManager class in Java offers a method that will yield the
 * recommended sample rate and buffer size for OpenSL.
 *
 * If you don't know the native buffer size, or if your processing callback
 * cannot operate at the native buffer size, then you should use a smallish
 * buffer size, e.g., 64 frames. Somewhat surprisingly, large buffers will not
 * improve stability.
 *
 * For the time being, the number of input and output channels must be 0, 1,
 * or 2; at least one of the channel numbers must be positive.
